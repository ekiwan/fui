# fui
> A flat UI library for the web

fui is a widely compatible UI library that provides clean, flat styling with pure CSS.


## Usage

Drop the `fui` folder into your project and include `fui.css`:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="fui/fui.css">
```

For IE support, you'll need to include [IE7.js], which is bundled with fui:

```html
<!-- IE Support -->
<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
<!--[if lt IE 9]>
	<script src="fui/scripts/ie7/IE9.js"></script>
<![endif]-->
```

[IE7.js]: https://code.google.com/p/ie7-js/


## Markup and CSS Classes

See the included examples.


## Browser compatibility

fui aims to look great on modern browsers and degrade gracefully. You'll find fui works nicely with the following browsers:

* IE 8+
* Firefox 3.6+
* Chrome
* Safari
* iOS Safari
